  <br><p align = "justify">This project focuses on automating exploration for underwater
  vehicles that operate in highly uncertain environments, including
  both environmental uncertainty and internal dynamic uncertainty.
  Environmental uncertainty can arise because the world may not be
  easy to model and agents in the world may behave in unexpected ways.
  Internal uncertainty can arise because the mechanics of motion are
  uncertain, for instance due to unknown and unknowable fluid
  mechanics.  The work involves developing online algorithms for
  underwater vehicles in Xiaobo Tan's group at Michigan State
  University, a collaborator on this project.  Moreover,
  decentralized/distributed algorithms are being developed as part of
  the work.</p>
