  <br><p align = "justify">This project is developing computationally efficient optimal
  and semi-optimal control methods.  The research is
  based on the prior development of sequential action control, a
  numerical iterative optimal control technique that often finds
  near-optimizers in a single iteration.  Using this technique as a
  starting point, we are interested in developing numerical techniques
  that can run in real-time for high dimensional nonlinear systems
  with provable guarantees of stability and near optimality.  The key
  starting point for the work is that sequential action control is a
  very simple control approach, only relying on a single control
  vector calculation at any given time, suggesting that near optimal
  solutions may be very simple to compute.  Goals for the research
  include theoretical guarantees, numerical methods, and experiments.
  Thus far we have been able to show that the existence of these
  optimizers depends on local nonlinear controllability.  Moreover,
  keeping track of the computations as one goes leads to stability
  guarantees.

      This project focuses on developing machine learning techniques that improve
      both short- and long-term prediction accuracy. We develop numerical methods
      that guarantee the stability of data-driven modeling, prediction, and
      control and can run in real time. We test these methods in simulations and
      experiments on various robotic systems and applications, including predicting
      the gait cycle of a biped, stabilizing a quadrotor, and tracking trajectories
      or pushing blocks using the Franka Emika robot.
