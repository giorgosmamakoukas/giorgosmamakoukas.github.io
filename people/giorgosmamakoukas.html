    <h3>Research</h3>
    <p>
    My research focuses on algorithmic development for underwater robotics,
    focusing on questions related to efficient algorithms for system identification,
    nonlinear control, and environmental exploration. More specifically, I have
    developed methods for controllability-based nonlinear control with guarantees
    for convergence and obstacle avoidance and techniques for linear embedding
    of nonlinear dynamics with explicit error bounds on model accuracy for the purposes of
    data-driven control. I enjoy investigating the properties and relations between
    different algorithms, such as single-action policies and traditional
    gradient descent, or feedback linearization and Koopman-operator based control.
    I am currently working on physics-based identification
    and control of dynamics.  </p>
