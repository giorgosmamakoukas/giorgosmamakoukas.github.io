		<h2 align = "center">Brady Scholar Fellow <br> (2016 - 19)</h2>

    The Brady Program in Ethics and Civic Life at Northwestern University is a
    selective scholarly community in which 16 undergraduates join together with
    graduate students and faculty to discuss political ethics and philosophical
    concepts and the application of these to local, national, and international
    communities. It combines a year-long examination of topics around moral
    political philosophy in small-classroom setting,
    exposure to a part of the world outside the U.S.,
    and a capstone project that addresses social, economic, or political issues
    in the Evanston community.

      <h2 align = "center">Outreach at Museum of Science and Industry <br>(2015 - 19)</h2>
      The Museum of Science and Industry and the Center of Robotics and
      Biosystems at Northwestern University together organize a 3-day Robot Block Party
      event at the museum during the annual National Robotics week. Since 2015, I attend, present to
      the public, and communicate my robotics research projects to hundreds of
      adults and children.

      <h2 align = "center">President of Mechanical Engineering Graduate Student Society <br>(2016 - 18) </h2>
      For two years, I served as the president of the Mechanical Engineering
      Graduate Student Body at Northwestern University. During this time, I

      <ul>
      <li> <font color="blue "> <b> Structured the student body</b> </font> by
        creating new positions with clear
        responsibilities, including positions for a Vice-President, Treasurer,
        Social Chair, Career Development Chair, and Website Developer. </li>
      <li> <font color="blue "> <b> Developed student networks</b> </font>
        and transition to graduate school by
        establishing new annual social, some targeted primarily to incoming
        students. </li>
      <li> <font color="blue "> <b> Initiated professional networking </b> </font>
        with weekly seminars from students and invited speakers. </li>
      <li> <font color="blue "> <b> Streamlined the communication and outreach

      <li> <font color="blue "> <b> Ensured smooth operation and transition </b> </font> by
        creating an online record of all protocols and directions (e.g. how to organize social events,
        hold elections, process finances). </li>

      </ul>

      <h2 align = "center">Supervisor of Science Teaching Assistants <br>(2013 - 14)</h2>
      After three years of serving as a Science Mentor (Physics and Math), I was
      promoted to the inagaural role of a "Meta-Mentor" to supervise and guide
      all science teaching assistants on improving their communication and teaching
      skills. Among others, I
      <ul>
      <li> <font color="blue "> <b> Evaluated all science teaching assistants </b> </font>
      (Math, Physics, Chemistry, Biology) by filming their lectures (~ 5hours/week) and noting strengths and weaknesses.

      </li>
      <li> <font color="blue "> <b> Improved their communication and teaching skills </b> </font>
      by using film footage to offer them constructive feedback and illustrate
      areas for improvement to better engage their audience.  </li>
