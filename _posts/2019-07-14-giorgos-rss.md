[Giorgos Mamakoukas](https://murpheylab.github.io/people/giorgosmamakoukas) presented a paper at the Robotics: Science and Systems conference in Freiburg im Bresigau, Germany. Many of the Murphey Lab students also traveled to Germany to support multiple papers, posters, and workshop talks,  as well as to host their own workshop on the use of AI in the field of human-machine interaction. Congratulations to the students for a productive conference!
